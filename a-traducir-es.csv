97584,"Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Darunavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7&gt;UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7&gt;UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier).

In theory, calcium could chelate with dolutegravir and potentially decrease the amount of dolutegravir available to bind to the active site of the HIV integrase. However, given that the extent of chelation is dependent on the amount of calcium, this risk is predicted to be low when administering calcium folinate in small doses at frequent intervals. Since calcium is distributed rapidly, separating the intake of dolutegravir from the IV administration of calcium folinate by 2 hours should eliminate any risk of chelation.",""

Temsavir is mainly metabolized by esterase-mediated hydrolysis with a small contribution of CYP3A4. Temsavir does not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes. However, dexamethasone is a moderate inducer of CYP3A4 but is unlikely to alter temsavir exposure significantly. Coadministration of fostemsavir with rifabutin (a moderate inducer) was shown to reduce the exposure of the active metabolite temsavir by 30%. This decrease was not considered to be clinically significant and did not warrant a dose adjustment of fostemsavir. This recommendation also applies when fostemsavir is coadministered with dexamethasone.",""

Although atazanavir inhibits P-gp, no dose adjustment of cabergoline is required when cabergoline is administered as a single dose to suppress lactation. No effect on ataznavir is expected as cabergoline does not inhibit or induce drug metabolizing enzymes.",""
125769,"Coadministration has not been studied but a clinically significant interaction is unlikely when cabergoline is administered as a single dose to suppress lactation. Cabergoline is extensively metabolized by the liver, predominantly via hydrolysis (non-CYP mediated metabolism), and is a substrate of P-gp. Cabergoline exposure was shown to increased 2.6- to 4-fold in the presence of the strong P-gp inhibitors itraconazole or clarithromycin. Although darunavir/ritonavir inhibits P-gp, no dose adjustment of cabergoline is required when cabergoline is administered as a single dose to suppress lactation. No effect on darunavir/ritonavir is expected as cabergoline does not inhibit or induce drug metabolizing enzymes.",""
125186,"Coadministration has not been studied. Fostemsavir is a prodrug and is hydrolysed to the active compound temsavir in the small intestine. Temsavir is mainly metabolized by esterase-mediated hydrolysis with a small contribution of CYP3A4. Cat’s claw is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vitro and increased concentrations of atazanavir, saquinavir and ritonavir were reported in a patient receiving Cat’s claw. However, cat’s claw is unlikely to significantly increase temsavir. Coadministration of fostemsavir with ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) was shown to increase temsavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 53%, 45% and 44%. These changes were not considered to be clinically significant and did not warrant a dose adjustment of fostemsavir.",""
124741,"Coadministration has not been studied. Clarithromycin is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp and coadministration is predicted to increase temsavir (the active metabolite of fostemsavir) but to a modest extent. Coadministration of fostemsavir with cobicistat (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) increased temsavir exposure by 93%. This increase was not considered to be clinically significant and did not warrant a dose adjustment of fostemsavir. Fostemsavir has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval at supra-therapeutic doses but these are unlikely to occur during coadministration with clarithromycin. However, given the known QT prolongation risk associated with clarithromycin, ECG monitoring is recommended when coadministering both drugs.",""
